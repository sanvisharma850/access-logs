  <p>If you're reading this, I'm already gone.</p>

  <p>I knew someone would try to clean up.<br>
  I knew they'd delete logs.<br>
  I knew they'd edit commits.<br>
  I knew they'd trust that systems forget.</p>

  <p>But I taught you better than that.</p>

  <p><strong>Systems don't forget.</strong><br>
  They just hide things in plain sight.</p>
